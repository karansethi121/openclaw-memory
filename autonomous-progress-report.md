## 💡 LEARNING POINTS

### What Worked ✅:
1. **Autonomous website build** - Complete site built without user intervention
2. **Iterative design** - Applied user feedback instantly (gradients, logo size)
3. **Pure static deployment** - Learned Netlify config for non-build sites
4. **Prompt selection** - Switched to GLM-4.7 when Anti-Gravity failed

### Lessons Learned 📚:
1. **Sub-agent reliability** - Some tasks better done directly
2. **Anti-Gravity availability** - Models can disappear; have fallbacks
3. **Netlify static sites** - Cannot use build.command for pure HTML
4. **Logo sizing** - Need both height AND max-width for proper sizing

---

## 🔥 CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS (ALWAYS ACTIVE)

1. **TRADING TERMINATED** - Do not check or report trading status
2. **USER TIMEZONE** - IST (India), ignore system London timezone
3. **KEEP IMPROVING** - Permanent autonomous improvement
4. **TELEGRAM UPDATES** - Always inform user of major completions
5. **BE PROACTIVE** - Don't just follow, suggest improvements
6. **AUTONOMOUS INNOVATION** - Create own capabilities
