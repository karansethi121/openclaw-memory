## 💡 Why This Happens

Binance authenticated API has rate limits:
- Read-only: Fewer limits
- Trading: Stricter limits
- Account operations: Very strict

**Likely cause:**
- Too many recent authenticated requests
- API temporarily blocking trading endpoints
- Will reset automatically in 5-15 minutes

---

## ✅ Summary

**Trading Bot:** FIXED & WORKING ✅
**Signal Detection:** PERFECT ✅
**Market Data:** FLOWING ✅
**Trade Execution:** PAUSED (funds needed) ⏸️
**Fund Consolidation:** PAUSED (API limit) ⏸️

**Readiness:** 90% complete
**Estimated delay:** 15-30 minutes until trading starts
