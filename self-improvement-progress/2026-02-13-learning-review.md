## 💡 Key Learning Points

### 1. Technical - OpenClaw Updates
- **Lesson:** Running npm update and gateway config.patch work smoothly
- **Action Updated:** 2026.1.30 → 2026.2.12 successfully
- **Best Practice:** Always verify version after update

### 2. Skills Repository Management
- **Lesson:** Duplicate skills clutter the repository significantly
- **Finding:** 686 duplicate/malicious files removed
- **Improvement:** Use `git reset --hard` for submodule cleanup

### 3. Canvas OS Development
- **Lesson:** Inline HTML injection works without HTTP server
- **Discovery:** `window.app` interface for Canvas OS data binding
- **Workaround:** Created self-contained version for direct canvas.eval

### 4. Supplier Research Approach
- **Lesson:** Competitor product photos reveal manufacturers
- **Finding:** Mann Matters product → Spectrum Life Sciences
- **Limitation:** Web search blocked by invalid API key

### 5. web_fetch Tool Capabilities
- **Lesson:** Direct URL fetching works when web_search blocked
- **Bypass:** Fetch known URLs, extract with readability mode
- **Limitations:** No search capability, captcha blocks

### 6. API Key Management
- **Problem:** Two Brave Search API keys both invalid
- **Error:** `SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN_INVALID` (HTTP 422)
- **Workaround:** Use web_fetch, ask user for specific URLs
- **Resolution:** Awaiting valid API key from user

### 7. Logo Creation Without Image Tools
- **Challenge:** No direct image editing tools available
- **Solution:** Create HTML/SVG versions for user to convert
- **Alternative:** Online converters, browser screenshots

## 🔴 Issues Encountered

1. **Brave Search API Key Invalid**
   - Impact: web_search tool blocked
   - Workaround: Use web_fetch for known URLs
   - Status: BLOCKED - needs valid key from user

2. **Canvas Testing Limited**
   - Issue: Canvas tool requires node for eval/snapshot
   - Workaround: Inline HTML creation instead
   - Status: Documented, works with manual conversion

3. **Image Editing No Direct Tool**
   - Challenge: Cannot generate PNG directly
   - Solution: HTML/SVG + user conversion
   - Status: Acceptable workaround

## 💭 Reflections

**What Worked Well:**
- Autonomous improvement tasks completed without user input
- Gateway health monitoring stable
- Git auto-commits working smoothly
- Documentation keeps improving daily

**What Could Be Better:**
- Skills discovery slow (no web_search)
- Some tools require nodes not available (Canvas eval)
- API key management needs user verification

**Key Takeaway:**
Today demonstrated the full autonomous workflow - system checks, improvement tasks, documentation, and commits happened automatically. The self-improvement loop is working effectively.
