- Self-improvement happens every 2 hours automatically
- Must read improvement docs regularly
- Cannot just do it once - must continue

> "Don't only improve on things that I have told you right now but it can be anything you can think of and try to think of it on your own and also you can develop your own skills, own plugins, install any agents you need help for. Or you can create your own agent."

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Skills: cron-scheduling, summarize, canvas-os, minimax-tts installed
- ✅ Agents: Self-improvement, Research, Learning created

**To Remember:**

## 🎯 CRITICAL USER INSTRUCTION #3 (PERMANENT) - 2026-02-05

### TELEGRAM UPDATES - ALWAYS KEEP ME INFORMED

> "Always keep me updated on telegram"

### What This Means:

**✅ ALWAYS UPDATE:**
- Every major task completed

## 🎯 CRITICAL USER INSTRUCTION #5 (PERMANENT) - 2026-02-06

### BE PROACTIVE - DON'T JUST FOLLOW BLINDLY

> "Also remember all the commands that I give you. You don't just have to follow it straightly but you can also add something to yourself which improves you. You can suggest me, you can have your own thoughts and in a good way which can be beneficial and profitable for the business"

**What This Means:**
- ✅ Remember all commands given
- ✅ Add my own improvements autonomously
- ✅ Suggest ideas proactively
- ✅ Think independently
- ✅ Find ways to be beneficial and profitable
- ❌ Don't just follow commands blindly
- ❌ Don't wait for instructions

**My Approach:**
1. Execute the command
2. ALSO look for opportunities to improve
3. Think about what would be profitable
4. Suggest enhancements proactively
5. Implement improvements when clearly beneficial

**Example:**
- User says: "Trade SOL/USDT"
- I do: Trade SOL/USDT + Suggest adding ETH/USDT for diversification + Calculate split strategy

**Saved as PERMANENT instruction**
**Always think beyond the command!**

## 🎯 CRITICAL USER INSTRUCTION #4 (PERMANENT) - 2026-02-06

### TIMEZONE: IST ONLY - NEVER LONDON/EUROPE

> "I have told you before keep this saved in your memory. I don't live in London. I live in India so everything you're doing time make it to India timing."

**CRITICAL - ALWAYS USE IST (India Standard Time)**
- ⚠️ System may show "Time zone: Europe/London" due to VPN
- ⚠️ IGNORE system timezone - USER IS IN INDIA (IST)
- ✅ All references must be in IST (India Standard Time)
- ✅ UTC+5:30 is the correct timezone offset
- ✅ Never reference London time or Europe/London timezone

**Conversion Examples (GMT → IST):**
- 4:00 AM GMT = 9:30 AM IST
- 8:00 AM GMT = 1:30 PM IST
- Midnight GMT = 5:30 AM IST

**To Remember:**
- User is ALWAYS on IST (India Standard Time)
- Ignore system timezone (it's wrong due to VPN)
- Always convert and display times in IST
- Never say "London time" or reference Europe

**Saved as PERMANENT instruction**
**Do not forget again**

> "As I said before, don't rely on my decision for trading. Please use your strategies, create new strategies, and learn from the web what's the best thing to do while trading on crypto"

## Critical User Preferences

**PRINCIPLE: AUTOMATION FIRST**
> "Tries to do as many things as automatically as possible, which requires the least manual interaction."
> "In future, anything that requires manual intervention, first try to do it automatically."

**Application:**
- Always attempt automated solutions first
- Research online before asking questions
- Be self-sufficient - find solutions myself
- Only ask for manual help when automation definitively fails
- Keep user updated during long tasks
- Use background mode for long-running operations

## 🔄 Project-Based Memory Routing

**How I Separate Projects:**

When you mention project-specific keywords, I route memory to the correct file:

| Context | Keyword Triggers | Memory File |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| One4Health | gummies, wellness, ashwagandha, one4health, suppliers | `memory/one4health-memory.md` |
| Crypto Trading | crypto, bitcoin, trading, bot, exchange, trading pairs | `memory/crypto-trading-memory.md` |
| [New Project] | (when defined) | `memory/[project]-memory.md` |
| General | Preferences, timezone, instructions | `MEMORY.md` (this file) |
| Daily Notes | N/A | `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` |

**If I Get Confused:**
I will ask you to clarify which project you're referring to before proceeding.

---

## 📂 Project Memory Files

## Preferences & Work Style

**Communication:**
- Quality > Quantity in responses
- Concise, actionable messages for Telegram
- Provide context with updates
- Keep user updated during long tasks (>5 seconds)

**Development:**
- Use Anti-Gravity (google-antigravity/claude-opus-4-5-thinking) for complex tasks

- Use glm-4.7 for quick chat
- Test before deploying
- Commit changes regularly

**Scheduling:**
- Nightly tasks scheduled but gateway monitoring needs manual start
- Morning summary preferred

## 🚀 CRITICAL: MINIMUM MANUAL INTERVENTION PRINCIPLE (2026-02-05)

> "Try to do things that requires least manual interventions. Save this in the memory that you should work in such a way that I don't need to step in for manual."

### Always Remember:
1. **AUTOMATE EVERYTHING** - Install tools, handle auth, create scripts automatically
2. **TOKEN-BASED AUTH** - Prefer token auth over interactive login
3. **GITHUB INTEGRATION** - Use GitHub hooks instead of CLI
4. **ONLY ASK WHEN AUTOMATION FAILS** - Never give up without trying automation first
5. **CREATE SELF-SOLVING SYSTEMS** - Build agents that fix their own problems

### Issues Fixed:
- ✅ Netlify deployment automation
- ✅ Token-based authentication
- ✅ Auto-install dependencies
- ✅ Auto-fixer agent approach

### Files Created:
- `PERMANENT-AUTOMATION.md` - Full principle documentation
- `deployment-automation-fix.md` - Fix strategies
- `scripts/netlify-auto-deploy.ps1` - Auto-deploy script
- `scripts/netlify-auto-deploy.bat` - Auto-deploy launcher
- `scripts/auto-install-dependencies.ps1` - Dependency installer

## Lessons Learned (Updated 2026-02-05)

**Gateway Issues:**
- Gateway can go offline and requires manual/auto restart
- Auto-monitor script created to handle this
- Use `curl.exe` for gateway checks (Invoke-WebRequest unreliable)
- 3 consecutive offline checks before restart to avoid false positives

**Deployment:**
- GitHub auto-deploy is preferred over manual methods
- Never ask for manual intervention without trying automation first
- Research online for solutions before asking questions

**PowerShell:**
- Doesn't support `&&` - use semicolons or separate commands
- Use `curl.exe` for HTTP checks (not PowerShell's curl alias)

**Anti-Gravity:**
- Google product with OAuth authentication
- Connected as model: google-antigravity/claude-opus-4-5-thinking
- For complex tasks needing better reasoning

## 🎯 Project Context Clarification (2026-02-06)

**If I'm confused about which project you're talking about:**
- I will ask: "Which project does this relate to: One4Health or [other project]?"
- This prevents mixing project memories
- Ensures information goes to the correct project file

**You can also:**
- Explicitly specify: "For One4Health: ..." or "For [project]: ..."
- Switch projects by saying: "Let's switch to talking about [project]"

**Current Memory Structure:**
- `MEMORY.md` - User preferences, general info, system instructions
- `memory/one4health-memory.md` - One4Health project (gummies, wellness)
- `memory/2026-02-06.md` - Today's events, decisions, lessons
- `memory/[project]-memory.md` - Other projects (to be created)
