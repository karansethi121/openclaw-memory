### 4. VITAMIN D2 ⚠️ CONCERN

**Vitamin D2 vs D3 Analysis:**

**Vitamin D2 (Ergocalciferol):**
- Plant-derived (typically from mushrooms/yeast)
- Less bioavailable than D3
- Shorter half-life in body
- Less potent than D3
- Traditional, less used in modern supplements

**Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol):**
- Animal-derived (lanolin from sheep wool)
- OR Plant-derived (lichen) for vegan D3
- Higher bioavailability
- Longer half-life
- More potent
- Preferred by most supplement brands
- Better clinical evidence

**Market Norm:**
- 90%+ of supplements use D3
- D2 is rarely used in new supplements
- Most competitors use D3

**CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION:**
**⚠️ CHANGE to Vitamin D3 (Vegan)**

**Why:**
1. **Superior Absorption:** D3 is 3-5x more effective
2. **Market Standard:** Competitors use D3
3. **Consumer Expectation:** D3 is preferred
4. **Vegan D3 Available:** Lichen-derived D3 is 100% vegan
5. **Better Efficacy:** Your product will work better with D3

**Cost Consideration:**
- Vegan D3 is slightly more expensive than D2
- But worth the small price increase for efficacy
- Marketing advantage: "Plant-based Vitamin D3"
