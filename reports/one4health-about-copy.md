## About One4Health

### Our Story

One4Health started with a simple belief: **wellness should be easy, effective, and accessible.**

We're based in **Lucknow, India** — the heartland of Ayurveda, where ancient healing wisdom meets modern science.

Our founder grew up watching generations turn to time-tested herbs like Ashwagandha for strength, balance, and resilience. But somewhere along the way, traditional wisdom got lost in complicated pills, bitter powders, and confusing labels.

We asked ourselves: *What if we could preserve that ancient wisdom in a form that fits today's busy life?*

**One4Health was born** — premium Ayurvedic supplements that taste good, are easy to take, and **work**.

### Our Mission

We exist to make daily wellness simple for everyone.

Our products are science-backed, rooted in tradition, and honestly priced. Whether you're managing work stress, chasing your kids, building a career, or running a business — you deserve to feel your best naturally.

**One gummy a day. That's it.**

### What We Believe

#### Simplicity Wins

Wellness shouldn't require 12 pills, 3 powders, and a complex schedule. We believe in doing **one thing really well**: making supplements that are easy to take, taste great, and deliver results.

#### Quality Over Everything

We use **KSM-66 Ashwagandha** because it's the most researched, highest-quality Ashwagandha extract available.

- We test every batch
- We use clean ingredients
- No shortcuts

#### Honest Pricing

You shouldn't need a premium budget for premium quality. We price fairly so more people can access real wellness.

#### From Lucknow, With Care

Products made in India, for India. We know what works for Indian bodies, diets, and lifestyles.

We started in Lucknow, and we're proud to bring modern Ayurvedic wellness from the City of Nawabs to homes across the country.

### Our First Product: Ashwagandha KSM-66 Gummies

Ashwagandha has been used in Ayurveda for over **3,000 years**. Known as the "strength-giving herb," it helps:

- ✅ Manage stress
- ✅ Boost energy
- ✅ Support restful sleep

We paired it with **KSM-66** — a 14-year-researched full-spectrum extract that preserves the whole root's bioactives for maximum benefit.

**30 gummies. 300mg KSM-66 per serving. Sugar-free. Vegan. One gummy (or two) a day. Simple.**

### The Future

This is just the beginning.

We're developing more products based on traditional Ayurvedic ingredients:

- **Multivitamins** for complete daily nutrition
- **Apple Cider Vinegar** for digestion
- **Energy boosters** for active lifestyles

All in gummy form. All with the same commitment to quality.
