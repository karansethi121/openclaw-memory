## ❌ CRITICAL FINDINGS - WHY APKAVIT IS NOT A FIT

### 1. **Wrong Business Model** 🚫
- **Pharmaceutical** company, NOT nutraceutical/supplement
- Focus on prescription drugs (tablets, capsules, syrups, injectables)
- Pharma franchise model (B2B doctors/distributors)
- **NOT** dietary supplement manufacturer

### 2. **No Gummy Manufacturing** 🚫
- Website lists zero gummy products
- Pharmaceutical dosage forms (tablets, capsules, injectables)
- **NO** mention of gummy manufacturing capability
- Pharmaceutical manufacturing ≠ Nutraceutical gummy manufacturing

### 3. **No Ashwagandha Expertise** 🚫
- Medical pharmaceutical products
- Ayurvedic range exists BUT focused on pharma formulations
- **NO** mention of ashwagandha or herbal supplements specifically

### 4. **No MOQ Information** ⚠️
- No mention of MOQ for custom manufacturing
- Franchise model focus (distributorship, not custom production)
- Business model is selling existing products, NOT custom manufacturing

### 5. **Certification Mismatch** 🚫
- Pharmaceutical certifications (DCGI - drug controller)
- **NOT** food/nutraceutical certifications (FSSAI required for gummies)
- GMP standards for drugs ≠ GMP standards for food supplements

### 6. **Business Model Incompatibility** 🚫
- Their model: Sell existing pharma products via franchise
- Your need: Custom formulation manufacturing (KSM-66 + D3 + BioPerine)
- They're a **seller**, NOT a **custom manufacturer**

---

## 🔍 LEGITIMACY ASSESSMENT

### Positive Indicators:
- ✅ Established business (15+ years)
- ✅ GMP certified (pharma)
- ✅ WHO standards compliance
- ✅ 2000+ trusted clients
- ✅ 5000+ approved products
- ✅ DCGI approved

### Negative Indicators:
- ❌ Wrong industry (pharmaceutical vs nutraceutical)
- ❌ No gummy manufacturing
- ❌ No ashwagandha specialization
- ❌ No FSS certification
- ❌ Inconsistent founding year (2000 vs 2010)
- ❌ No custom MOQ information

### Legitimacy: **NOT RELEVANT**
They appear to be a legitimate **pharmaceutical** company, but **NOT** a **nutraceutical gummy manufacturer**.
