## FSSAI REGULATIONS ON VITAMIN D

### Key Facts About Vitamin D2 vs D3 in FSSAI Regulations:

**1. Both D2 and D3 are PERMITTED in Food Supplements**

According to FSSAI Food Safety and Standards (Health Supplements, Nutraceuticals, Botanicals, and Other Food) Regulations, 2016:

- **Vitamin D2 (Ergocalciferol):** PERMITTED
- **Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol):** PERMITTED

**Both forms of Vitamin D are listed as PERMITTED vitamins** in the FSSAI regulations for health supplements and nutraceuticals.

### 2. Vitamin D in Daily Value (DV)

**FSSAI Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for Vitamin D:**
- **Per Serving:** 5-15 µg (200-600 IU)
- **Per Day:** 5-15 µg (200-600 IU)

**Your Proposed Dose:**
- Vitamin D3: 10 µg (400 IU) ✅ **WITHIN LIMITS**

Your dose of 400 IU (10 µg) is well within the FSSAI permissible range of 200-600 IU per day.

### 3. Source of Vitamin D3 - Important Considerations

**Animal-Derived Vitamin D3:**
- Source: Lanolin from sheep wool
- Issue: Not vegetarian/vegan
- FSSAI Status: PERMITTED but must be declared

**Plant-Derived (Vegan) Vitamin D3:**
- Source: Lichen (fungi)
- Issue: None - plant-based
- FSSAI Status: PERMITTED (same as D3 from animal sources)
- Declaration: Must specify "from lichen" or "plant-based"

**FSSAI Regulation View:**
- FSSAI regulates the **form** of Vitamin D (D2 or D3), not the **source**
- Both animal-derived and plant-derived D3 are chemically identical (cholecalciferol)
- As long as it meets quality standards, the source is not a licensing issue

### 4. Labeling Requirements for Vitamin D

According to FSSAI labeling regulations:

**Mandatory Label Declarations:**
1. **Vitamin Source:** Must declare "Vitamin D3" explicitly
2. **Source (for vegan):** If using plant-based D3, can label "Vitamin D3 (from lichen)" or "Plant-based Vitamin D3"
3. ** Quantity:** Must declare in µg (micrograms) with IU in parentheses
4. **%RDA:** Percentage of Recommended Dietary Allowance

**Example Label:**
```
Vitamin D3: 10 µg (400 IU) | 200% RDA*
*Based on ICMR RDA for adults
```

**For Vegan Products:**
```
Vitamin D3 (from lichen): 10 µg (400 IU) | 200% RDA*
100% Plant-Based
```

   - License covers "Vitamin D" as category
   - Form change (D2→D3) doesn't require new license

3. **Within Permitted Limits:**
   - Your dose (400 IU) is within FSSAI RDA (200-600 IU)
   - No special approval needed

4. **Source Doesn't Affect License:**
   - Animal vs plant source doesn't change licensing
   - Both chemically identical compound (cholecalciferol)

## RECOMMENDED ACTION

**NO ACTION REQUIRED** for changing from D2 to D3:
- Your existing FSSAI license permits Vitamin D3
- Form change doesn't require amendment
- Dose is within permissible limits

### For Labeling:

**PROPER DECLARATION REQUIRED:**
1. Declare as "Vitamin D3" (not just "Vitamin D")
2. Specify quantity: "10 µg (400 IU)"
3. If vegan, mention source: "from lichen" or "Plant-based"
4. Show %RDA: 200% (based on ICMR guidelines)
