## CONCERNS / RED FLAGS ⚠️

### 1. Certification Transparency Issues

**Certificates Page Content:**
- Expected: Actual certificate images or document details
- Found: Only addresses of 5 units listed
- **Missing:** No certificate numbers, issue dates, issuing authority details
- **Missing:** No downloadable certificates
- **Missing:** No visible verification links

**Awards Page Content:**
- Expected: Award images, recognition details
- Found: Only addresses of 5 units listed
- **Missing:** No award certificate images
- **Missing:** No awarding organization details
- **Missing:** No award year or category

**Critique:** This is a significant issue. A legitimate manufacturer with genuine certifications would typically:
- Display certificate images on their website
- Include certificate numbers for verification
- Provide details of certifying bodies
- Allow prospective clients to download or verify certificates

---

### 2. Contact Information Limitations

**No Direct Phone Number:**
- Website has contact form but no direct phone/email prominently displayed
- International units have some phone numbers but main India unit doesn't

**Inconsistent Contact Options:**
- Uganda unit: +256 741276971
- Nepal unit: +977-9820987991
- India unit: No phone number visible

---

### 3. MOQ Concern

**Minimum Order Quantity:** 30,000 gummies
- Compared to Bliss Life Sciences: 60,000 gummies
- Lower MOQ could indicate:
  - Smaller manufacturing capacity
  - Fewer existing orders
  - More flexible/aggressive pricing strategy
  - Less established operations

**Note:** This is not necessarily negative, but worth considering in context.

---

### 4. Limited Client Information

**Missing:**
- No client testimonials or case studies
- No partner company names
- No recognizable brand clients mentioned
- No client success stories

**Analysis:** A legitimate manufacturer with 10+ years experience would typically showcase successful client partnerships.

---

### 5. No Business Registration Details

**Missing:**
- Company registration number (India)
- GST number
- FSSAI license number
- Legal entity registration details

**Analysis:** Indian companies typically display GST and business registration details for transparency and trust.

## FINAL RATING

**United Laboratories:**
- **Legitimacy:** ⚠️ **MODERATE** (verifiable claims but lack transparency)
- **Risk Level:** ⚠️ **MEDIUM-HIGH** (requires additional due diligence)
- **Recommendation:** Verify thoroughly before proceeding

**Bliss Life Sciences:**
- **Legitimacy:** ✅ **HIGH** (better transparency, social proof, verified LinkedIn)
- **Risk Level:** ⚠️ **LOW-MEDIUM** (more transparent, documented)
- **Recommendation:** Safer choice if MOQ allows

---

## CONCLUSION

United Laboratories shows **signs of being legitimate** but the lack of certificate transparency is concerning for a company claiming to have WHO, GMP, ISO, FSSAI certifications.

**Critical Decision Factor:** Does the 50% lower MOQ (30,000 vs 60,000) justify the additional verification effort and risk?

**My Recommendation:** If budget allows, **Bliss Life Sciences** presents as the lower-risk, more transparent option. **United Labs** is viable ONLY if you can fully verify all certifications and get client references.
