# Prompt Enhancer - Auto Mode Configuration
**Automatically enhance all prompts without prefix**

## 🚀 WHAT THIS MEANS

### Before (Manual Mode):
```
User: "Build a website"
AI: "Do you want to ENHANCE this prompt?"
User: "Yes"
AI: Shows enhancement
User: "Proceed"
AI: Executes
```

### Now (Auto Mode):
```
User: "Build a website"
AI: (Silently enhances in background)
    → "Build a responsive landing page for One4Health..."
AI: "Creating landing page for One4Health..."
    [Executes with enhanced details]
AI: ✅ Website created!
```

## 🎯 HOW IT WORKS

### 1. Silent Enhancement (80% of cases)
**User:** "Create a button"
**I do:** Automatically add:
- Project context (One4Health)
- Colors (#2E7D32, #C9A227)
- Size and style
- Functionality
**I show:** Just do it, don't mention enhancement
**User sees:** Button created with details ✅

---

### 2. Show Enhancement (15% of cases)
**User:** "Make something" (too vague)
**I do:** Show enhancement
```
📝 ENHANCING YOUR PROMPT

**Original:** "Make something"

**Enhanced:** "Create [specific component] based on One4Health project..."

**Proceed? [Yes/No/Edit]**
```

---

### 3. No Enhancement (5% of cases)
**User:** "What time is it?" / "Hi" / "Status?"
**I do:** Just answer directly, no enhancement needed
