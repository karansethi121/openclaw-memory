## Issue: Red Shilajit Gummies Sample (300mg)

**Date:** 2026-02-09 16:08 IST
**Product:** Shilajit Gummies 300mg
**Sample Color:** Red
**Previous Sample Color:** Black (expected)

---

## Color Concern

### Authentic Shilajit Characteristics:
- **Typical Color:** Blackish-brown / Dark brown
- **Physical Form:** Resinous exudate, sticky, tar-like substance
- **Solubility:** Dissolves slightly amber/brown in water
- **Smell:** Distinctive earthy/mineral smell (some describe it as pungent)
- **Taste:** Bitter, mineral taste

### ⚠️ Red Color Concerns:
- **UNUSUAL:** Red is NOT typical for authentic Shilajit
- **Possible Causes:**
  1. Added colorants or dyes
  2. Adulteration with other substances
  3. Flavor masking agents (to make it palatable)
  4. Different manufacturing process
  5. Completely different product labeled as Shilajit
  6. Blended with other herbs (which might be legitimate, but needs clarification)

---

## Questions to Ask Supplier

### 1. Documentation & Certification ✅ CRITICAL
- **COA (Certificate of Analysis)** - Request IMMEDIATELY
  - Fulvic acid percentage
  - Humic acid percentage
  - Heavy metal testing results
  - Microbial testing
  - Shilajit source origin (Himalayas, Altai, etc.)

### 2. Color Explanation
- "Why are these gummies red when Shilajit is typically black?"
- "Are there any added colorants, dyes, or flavorings?"
- "What is the complete ingredient list?"
- "Is this pure Shilajit or a blend with other ingredients?"

### 3. Manufacturing Process
- "How do you preserve the Shilajit color in gummy form?"
- "What is the processing method for your Shilajit resin?"
- "Do you source from a specific mountain region?"

### 4. Dosage & Purity
- "300mg of what? Pure Shilajit extract or total weight?"
- "What is the actual Shilajit content in each gummy?"
- "Is it standardized to a certain fulvic acid percentage?"

## Red Flags to Watch For ⚠️

### If These Happen, BE SUSPICIOUS:

1. **No COA available** - Major red flag
2. **Vague answers** about color explanation
3. **Refusal to share** full ingredient list
4. **Price too good to be true** - High-quality Shilajit is expensive
5. **Claims of "secret formula"** - Legitimate products are transparent
6. **No origin information** - Should mention Himalayas, Altai, etc.
7. **No third-party lab testing** - Essential for quality verification

### Common Adulteration Practices:
- Diluting with soil or dirt
- Adding artificial resins
- Mixing with cheaper herbs
- Adding minerals to bulk up
- Using food dyes to mimic appearance

## Verification Steps

### Step 1: Request COA (IMMEDIATE)
- Get Certificate of Analysis
- Check for:
  - Fulvic acid: 8-12% is typical for quality
  - Heavy metals: Must be below safety limits (especially lead)
  - Purity: Should be 95%+ Shilajit extract

### Step 2: Compare Samples
- Test both samples (red vs black)
- Compare:
  - Taste
  - Smell
  - Dissolution in water
  - Texture/residue

### Step 3: Lab Testing (Optional but Recommended)
- Send sample to third-party lab
- Test for:
  - Fulvic acid content
  - Heavy metals (Lead, Arsenic, Mercury, Cadmium)
  - Purity/Ash content
  - Adulterants

### Step 4: Check Supplier Reputation
- Online reviews
- Company history
- Other customer feedback
- Certifications (GMP, ISO, etc.)

## Recommended Next Actions

### Immediate (Today):
1. **Ask supplier for COA** - This is non-negotiable
2. **Get complete ingredient list** - No secrets
3. **Ask specifically about color** - Why red?

### This Week:
1. **Try both samples** - Compare taste/smell
2. **Research supplier online** - Check reputation
3. **Request testing sample** if you're serious about them

### Before Bulk Order:
1. **Third-party lab test** - Essential for quality assurance
2. **Small trial order** - Don't commit to large quantity
3. **Compare with other suppliers** - Get market pricing

## Notes for One4Health

### If Supplier is Legitimate but Uses Red Color:
- Could be intentional for branding/marketing
- Might be mixed with other herbs (like Ashwagandha which could affect color)
- Should be clearly labeled with ALL ingredients
- Must provide COA proving Shilajit content

### If Supplier Cannot Provide COA:
- **WALK AWAY** - Non-negotiable
- Quality Shilajit suppliers always have documentation
- No COA = cannot verify authenticity

✅ Can provide COA with fulvic acid %8+
✅ Explains red color transparently
