### Market Analysis & Strategy Gap (15:15 IST)

**Current Market State:**
- Trend: Strong upward (BTC ~$68,300)
- RSI: 65-84 (strong momentum, not overbought yet)
- Strategy Issue: Waiting for RSI < 35 (oversold) isn't working

**User Feedback (14:54 GMT):**
> "Explore all the currencies, you can for better profit and better number of trades in minimum value trade"

**Problem Identified:**
1. Multi-currency scalping waits for oversold (RSI < 35)
2. Market is strong uptrend (RSI 65-84)
3. Bot sees "WAIT" on all 20 pairs
4. Missing opportunities in strong market

**Autonomous Solution Needed:**
- Create momentum-based strategy (not counter-trend)
- Trade on RSI breakouts: RSI 50 → 60 → 70
- Profit from upward movement, not pullbacks
- Execute across all 20 pairs simultaneously
- Minimum trades ($5) on multiple currencies

---

### Strategy Options (Autonomous Planning)

**Option 1: Momentum Breakout Bot**
```
Entry condition: RSI crosses above 50 (momentum shift)
Take profit: +0.3% (quick profits)
Stop loss: -0.15%
Check interval: 5s
Works in: Uptrending markets ✅
```

**Option 2: Multi-Pair Diversified Trading**
```
Strategy: Trade top 5-10 pairs simultaneously
Position size: $2-3 per pair (small, diverse trades)
Entry: RSI 45-55 range (neutral zone)
TP: +0.25%
SL: -0.15%
More trades, lower per-trade risk
```

**Option 3: Volatile Altcoins Focus**
```
Focus on: DOGE, SHIB, PEPE (high volatility)
Higher swings per trade
Faster profit cycles
Higher risk, more frequent wins
```

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Market Adaptation Required:** Same strategy fails in different market types
   - Counter-trend (RSI < 35) works in bear/crash markets
   - Momentum strategy needed for strong uptrends

2. **Futures Minimum Notional:** Not just BTC - ALL futures have $100 minimum
   - Cannot trade futures with $7
   - BNB speculation was wrong - same $100 minimum applies

3. **Strategy Diversification:** Need multiple strategies for different market types
   - Current: Only counter-trend (waiting for pullbacks)
   - Missing: Momentum, breakout, volatility-based strategies

4. **User Wants Volume:** "Better number of trades in minimum value"
   - Execute many small trades instead of waiting for perfect setup
   - Trade across all 20 pairs
