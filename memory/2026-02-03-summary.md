# Chat History Summary - 2026-02-03

## Context from Previous Telegram Conversation (Feb 2-3, 2026)

### 1. OpenClaw Setup & Configuration
- Telegram bot connected successfully after pairing issues were resolved
- Configured dmPolicy from "pairing" to "allowlist" with user ID 8284494839
- Enabled full tool profile: web search (Brave Search API), web fetch, image understanding, link understanding, browser control, memory search, native commands
- Audio understanding enabled (transcription service not yet configured)

### 2. Model Strategy
- Downloaded phi3:mini (2.2GB, lightweight) for casual chatting
- Configured glm-4.7:cloud for complex tasks
- Deepseek models being downloaded: deepseek-r1 (reasoning) and deepseek-coder (coding)
- User wants different models for different purposes:
  - Brain/reasoning: deepseek-r1
  - Coding: deepseek-coder  
  - Web search: configured Brave Search
  - Social search: Grok (API needed)
- Decision: Went with open-source models via Ollama (not external APIs)

### 3. Browser Control Attempts
- Attempted to open YouTube/Brave browser via OpenClaw extension
- Extension relay issues - extension kept disconnecting
- Tried both Chrome extension and openclaw-managed browser
- Bot control was attempted but had connectivity issues
