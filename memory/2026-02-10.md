### Task: Skills Discovery - Canvas OS Skill

**What I Did:**
- Attempted to install "canvas" skill via clawhub
- Discovered skill is actually "canvas-os" (Canvas OS)
- Found canvas-os is **already installed** in workspace
- Read SKILL.md for canvas-os to understand capabilities

**Key Findings:**
1. **canvas-os** is already installed at `skills/canvas-os/`
2. **Status:** The skill is installed and ready to use
3. **Purpose:** Canvas as an app platform - build, store, and run rich visual apps on OpenClaw Canvas
4. **Capabilities:**
   - Full HTML/CSS/JS UIs
   - Real-time updates via JS eval
   - Multiple apps (Dashboard, Tracker, Timer, etc.)
   - Port-based app serving (9876+)
   - Direct HTML injection for quick displays

**How It Works:**
1. Apps are HTML/CSS/JS files in `~/.openclaw/workspace/apps/[app-name]/`
2. Serve via localhost: `python3 -m http.server [PORT]`
3. Navigate Canvas to localhost URL
4. Inject data via JavaScript eval

**Key Files:**
- `skills/canvas-os/SKILL.md` - Main documentation
- `skills/canvas-os/CANVAS-LOADING.md` - Loading methods guide
- `skills/canvas-os/canvas-inject.py` - Helper for HTML injection

**Security Notes:**
- Canvas blocks `file:///` paths (sandboxing)
- Use localhost or direct HTML injection
- `openclaw-canvas://` URL scheme has issues - use `http://localhost:` instead

**Current Skills Status (7 enabled):**
1. ✅ bluebubbles - Channel integration
2. ✅ github - GitHub integration
3. ✅ skill-creator - Create new skills
4. ✅ summarize - URL/content summarization
5. ✅ video-frames - Extract video frames
6. ✅ analytics - Track metrics, Chart.js visualization
7. ✅ cron-scheduling - Cron jobs and timers
