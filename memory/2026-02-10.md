### Task: Skills Discovery - Canvas OS Skill

**What I Did:**
- Attempted to install "canvas" skill via clawhub
- Discovered skill is actually "canvas-os" (Canvas OS)
- Found canvas-os is **already installed** in workspace
- Read SKILL.md for canvas-os to understand capabilities

**Key Findings:**
1. **canvas-os** is already installed at `skills/canvas-os/`
2. **Status:** The skill is installed and ready to use
3. **Purpose:** Canvas as an app platform - build, store, and run rich visual apps on OpenClaw Canvas
4. **Capabilities:**
   - Full HTML/CSS/JS UIs
   - Real-time updates via JS eval
   - Multiple apps (Dashboard, Tracker, Timer, etc.)
   - Port-based app serving (9876+)
   - Direct HTML injection for quick displays

**How It Works:**
1. Apps are HTML/CSS/JS files in `~/.openclaw/workspace/apps/[app-name]/`
2. Serve via localhost: `python3 -m http.server [PORT]`
3. Navigate Canvas to localhost URL
4. Inject data via JavaScript eval

**Key Files:**
- `skills/canvas-os/SKILL.md` - Main documentation
- `skills/canvas-os/CANVAS-LOADING.md` - Loading methods guide
- `skills/canvas-os/canvas-inject.py` - Helper for HTML injection

**Security Notes:**
- Canvas blocks `file:///` paths (sandboxing)
- Use localhost or direct HTML injection
- `openclaw-canvas://` URL scheme has issues - use `http://localhost:` instead

**Current Skills Status (7 enabled):**
1. ✅ bluebubbles - Channel integration
2. ✅ github - GitHub integration
3. ✅ skill-creator - Create new skills
4. ✅ summarize - URL/content summarization
5. ✅ video-frames - Extract video frames
6. ✅ analytics - Track metrics, Chart.js visualization
7. ✅ cron-scheduling - Cron jobs and timers
8. ✅ canvas-os - UI Canvas app platform (discovered already installed)

**Next Steps for Canvas OS:**
- Build a simple dashboard app for OpenClaw monitoring
- Test canvas tool with a basic app
- Create analytics visualization on Canvas

**Documentation Updated:**
- self-improvement.md - Added this entry
- Will update skills-analysis.md when done

## Prompt Enhancer Status - 11:35 AM IST

### User Question: "Is the prompt enhancer working and is it enhancing the prompt automatically on all the messages that I sent?"

### My Answer: **NO - Prompt Enhancer is NOT Working**

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Code exists: `scripts/prompt-enhancer.ps1`, `scripts/prompt-enhancer-integration.ps1`
- ✅ Config exists: `config/prompt-enhancer.json` (enabled: true)
- ✅ Log file exists: `logs/prompt-enhancements.log` (only 1 entry from Feb 3)
- ❌ **NOT integrated** into OpenClaw's message pipeline
- ❌ **NOT intercepting** messages before they reach the agent
- ❌ **NOT enhancing** any messages automatically

**What the Code Does:**
- Analyze prompts for clarity, specificity, context
- Add constraints, break down broad tasks
- Show "before → after" comparison
- Require user approval before using enhanced prompt

**What's Missing:**
The prompt-enhancer-integration.ps1 script is designed to be called by OpenClaw's message handler, but there's no actual integration hook in OpenClaw's core system.

**Current Behavior:**
All messages go directly to the agent without enhancement. No preprocessing occurs.

**What the Integration Script Does (conceptually):**
```powershell
Process-Message -message $InputMessage
→ Runs enhancer
→ Check if enhancement happened
→ If yes → Return enhanced prompt for approval
→ If no → Return original message
```

---

### Why It's Not Working

The prompt-enhancer was **built but never connected** to OpenClaw's message processing pipeline. It operates as a standalone script that would need to be:
1. Called by OpenClaw's core message handler
2. Installed as a pre-processing middleware
3. Or used manually before sending messages

---

### Options to Enable It

#### Option 1: Native Integration (Requires OpenClaw Update)
- Add message preprocessing hook to OpenClaw core
- The prompt-enhancer would be called automatically
- This requires changes to OpenClaw gateway/daemon
- Status: **Not currently available**

#### Option 2: Manual Usage (Available NOW)
I can simulate prompt enhancement by:
1. Analyzing your message quality
2. Asking clarification questions if unclear
3. Suggesting improvements before proceeding

This is what I'm doing now (conversational enhancement).

#### Option 3: Build a Wrapper Script
Create a script that:
1. Monitors incoming messages
2. Calls prompt-enhancer.ps1
3. Returns enhanced version
4. Sends to OpenClaw agent

**Complexity:** Medium (needs to intercept/process messages)

---

### Current Approach

I'm already doing prompt enhancement behaviorally:
- When you say "build the website" → I ask details
- When you say "status" → I check which project
- When vague → I ask follow-up questions

But it's **NOT automatic** or structured like the prompt-enhancer tool.

---

### Files Exist

```
assets/prompt-enhancer-demo.js          - Demo loader
assets/prompt-enhancer-demo.html       - Demo interface
assets/prompt-enhancer.js              - Core JavaScript
config/prompt-enhancer.json            - Configuration
logs/prompt-enhancements.log           - Only 1 entry (2026-02-03 16:54)
scripts/prompt-enhancer.ps1            - Main enhancer
scripts/prompt-enhancer-integration.ps1 - Integration layer
scripts/test-prompt-enhancer.ps1        - Test script
projects/prompt-enhancer-*.md          - Multiple documentation files
```

**Status:** Built & documented, but **not integrated/running**

---

### User Decision Requested

**Want me to:**
1. **Keep using conversational enhancement** (current approach - working)
2. **Build a wrapper script** to auto-enhance before agent processing
3. **Wait for OpenClaw core integration** (not available yet)

**Awaiting user decision.**

## Self-Improvement Check - 01:30 PM IST

### Task: Agent Capability Testing - Task Skill

**What I Did:**
- Tested the newly installed **task skill** (v0.1.0)
- Attempted to run tasker CLI commands
- Discovered installation requirements

### Test Results:

#### Task Skill Test ⚠️ **REQUIRES SETUP**
- **Error:** `tasker` binary not found in system
- **Root Cause:** Skill requires external CLI tool installation
- **Requirements from README:**
  - `tasker` CLI binary available via plugin `binary` config
  - OR `TASKER_BIN` environment variable
  - OR in system PATH
  - Plugin tool `tasker_cmd` allowlisted

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Skill code installed
- ✅ Documentation available
- ❌ `tasker` CLI NOT installed
- ❌ Plugin tool NOT configured

**What This Means:**
The task skill is a **high-level integration** that requires:
1. External binary installation (tasker CLI)
2. Plugin tool configuration in OpenClaw
3. Proper PATH or environment variable setup

**Discovery:** Some skills are "documentation templates" while others are "complete integrations"
- **task** - Requires external binary + plugin tool setup
- **seo-content-writer** - Pure documentation/guidance (no binary)
- **automation-workflowsv** - Pure documentation/guidance (no binary)
- **minimax-tts** - Complete integration with working executable ✅

### Lessons Learned:

1. **Skill Types Vary:**
   - **Type A: Complete Integration** - Ready to use (minimax-tts, image optimization)
   - **Type B: Documentation** - Guidance only (seo-content-writer, automation-workflowsv)
   - **Type C: Plugin Required** - Needs external setup (task)

2. **Task Skill Value (If Set Up):**
   - Task management for One4Health project
   - Deadline tracking
   - Todo lists via Telegram
   - Week planning view

3. **Setup Required for Task Skill:**
   - Download/install tasker CLI binary
   - Configure OpenClaw plugin: `tasker_cmd`
   - Set `tasker` binary config
   - Test integration

### Recommendation:

**For Now:** Document the discovery and defer task skill setup. More value in:
- Testing skills that work out-of-the-box
- Using simple task lists in MD files
- Building integrations for immediate needs

**Setup Task Skill When:**
- Need complex task management with Telegram
- Have time to configure plugins
- tasker CLI is easily accessible

### Other Skill Testing Completed Today:

✅ **minimax-tts** (09:30 AM) - Working perfectly
✅ **web_fetch** (01:30 PM) - Fetching Netlify page successfully
- Status: web_fetch working for summarize capability
