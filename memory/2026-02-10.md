### Task: Skills Discovery - Canvas OS Skill

**What I Did:**
- Attempted to install "canvas" skill via clawhub
- Discovered skill is actually "canvas-os" (Canvas OS)
- Found canvas-os is **already installed** in workspace
- Read SKILL.md for canvas-os to understand capabilities

**Key Findings:**
1. **canvas-os** is already installed at `skills/canvas-os/`
2. **Status:** The skill is installed and ready to use
3. **Purpose:** Canvas as an app platform - build, store, and run rich visual apps on OpenClaw Canvas
4. **Capabilities:**
   - Full HTML/CSS/JS UIs
   - Real-time updates via JS eval
   - Multiple apps (Dashboard, Tracker, Timer, etc.)
   - Port-based app serving (9876+)
   - Direct HTML injection for quick displays

**How It Works:**
1. Apps are HTML/CSS/JS files in `~/.openclaw/workspace/apps/[app-name]/`
2. Serve via localhost: `python3 -m http.server [PORT]`
3. Navigate Canvas to localhost URL
4. Inject data via JavaScript eval

**Key Files:**
- `skills/canvas-os/SKILL.md` - Main documentation
- `skills/canvas-os/CANVAS-LOADING.md` - Loading methods guide
- `skills/canvas-os/canvas-inject.py` - Helper for HTML injection

**Security Notes:**
- Canvas blocks `file:///` paths (sandboxing)
- Use localhost or direct HTML injection
- `openclaw-canvas://` URL scheme has issues - use `http://localhost:` instead

**Current Skills Status (7 enabled):**
1. ✅ bluebubbles - Channel integration
2. ✅ github - GitHub integration
3. ✅ skill-creator - Create new skills
4. ✅ summarize - URL/content summarization
5. ✅ video-frames - Extract video frames
6. ✅ analytics - Track metrics, Chart.js visualization
7. ✅ cron-scheduling - Cron jobs and timers
8. ✅ canvas-os - UI Canvas app platform (discovered already installed)

**Next Steps for Canvas OS:**

## Prompt Enhancer Status - 11:35 AM IST

### User Question: "Is the prompt enhancer working and is it enhancing the prompt automatically on all the messages that I sent?"

### My Answer: **NO - Prompt Enhancer is NOT Working**

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Code exists: `scripts/prompt-enhancer.ps1`, `scripts/prompt-enhancer-integration.ps1`
- ✅ Config exists: `config/prompt-enhancer.json` (enabled: true)
- ✅ Log file exists: `logs/prompt-enhancements.log` (only 1 entry from Feb 3)
- ❌ **NOT integrated** into OpenClaw's message pipeline
- ❌ **NOT intercepting** messages before they reach the agent
- ❌ **NOT enhancing** any messages automatically

**What the Code Does:**
- Analyze prompts for clarity, specificity, context
- Add constraints, break down broad tasks
- Show "before → after" comparison
- Require user approval before using enhanced prompt

**What's Missing:**
The prompt-enhancer-integration.ps1 script is designed to be called by OpenClaw's message handler, but there's no actual integration hook in OpenClaw's core system.

**Current Behavior:**
All messages go directly to the agent without enhancement. No preprocessing occurs.

**What the Integration Script Does (conceptually):**
```powershell
Process-Message -message $InputMessage
→ Runs enhancer
→ Check if enhancement happened
→ If yes → Return enhanced prompt for approval
→ If no → Return original message
```

---

### Why It's Not Working

The prompt-enhancer was **built but never connected** to OpenClaw's message processing pipeline. It operates as a standalone script that would need to be:
1. Called by OpenClaw's core message handler
2. Installed as a pre-processing middleware
3. Or used manually before sending messages

---

### Options to Enable It

#### Option 1: Native Integration (Requires OpenClaw Update)
- Add message preprocessing hook to OpenClaw core
- The prompt-enhancer would be called automatically
- This requires changes to OpenClaw gateway/daemon
- Status: **Not currently available**

#### Option 2: Manual Usage (Available NOW)
I can simulate prompt enhancement by:
1. Analyzing your message quality
2. Asking clarification questions if unclear
3. Suggesting improvements before proceeding

This is what I'm doing now (conversational enhancement).

#### Option 3: Build a Wrapper Script
Create a script that:
1. Monitors incoming messages
2. Calls prompt-enhancer.ps1
3. Returns enhanced version
4. Sends to OpenClaw agent

**Complexity:** Medium (needs to intercept/process messages)

---

### Current Approach

I'm already doing prompt enhancement behaviorally:
- When you say "build the website" → I ask details
- When you say "status" → I check which project
- When vague → I ask follow-up questions

But it's **NOT automatic** or structured like the prompt-enhancer tool.

---

### Files Exist

```
assets/prompt-enhancer-demo.js          - Demo loader
assets/prompt-enhancer-demo.html       - Demo interface
assets/prompt-enhancer.js              - Core JavaScript
config/prompt-enhancer.json            - Configuration
logs/prompt-enhancements.log           - Only 1 entry (2026-02-03 16:54)
scripts/prompt-enhancer.ps1            - Main enhancer
scripts/prompt-enhancer-integration.ps1 - Integration layer
scripts/test-prompt-enhancer.ps1        - Test script
projects/prompt-enhancer-*.md          - Multiple documentation files
```

**Status:** Built & documented, but **not integrated/running**

---

### User Decision Requested

**Want me to:**
1. **Keep using conversational enhancement** (current approach - working)
2. **Build a wrapper script** to auto-enhance before agent processing
3. **Wait for OpenClaw core integration** (not available yet)

**Awaiting user decision.**

## Self-Improvement Check - 01:30 PM IST

### Task: Agent Capability Testing - Task Skill

**What I Did:**
- Tested the newly installed **task skill** (v0.1.0)
- Attempted to run tasker CLI commands
- Discovered installation requirements

### Test Results:

#### Task Skill Test ⚠️ **REQUIRES SETUP**
- **Error:** `tasker` binary not found in system
- **Root Cause:** Skill requires external CLI tool installation
- **Requirements from README:**
  - `tasker` CLI binary available via plugin `binary` config
  - OR `TASKER_BIN` environment variable
  - OR in system PATH
  - Plugin tool `tasker_cmd` allowlisted

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Skill code installed
- ✅ Documentation available
- ❌ `tasker` CLI NOT installed
- ❌ Plugin tool NOT configured

**What This Means:**
The task skill is a **high-level integration** that requires:
1. External binary installation (tasker CLI)
2. Plugin tool configuration in OpenClaw
3. Proper PATH or environment variable setup

**Discovery:** Some skills are "documentation templates" while others are "complete integrations"
- **task** - Requires external binary + plugin tool setup
- **seo-content-writer** - Pure documentation/guidance (no binary)
- **automation-workflowsv** - Pure documentation/guidance (no binary)
- **minimax-tts** - Complete integration with working executable ✅

### Lessons Learned:

1. **Skill Types Vary:**
   - **Type A: Complete Integration** - Ready to use (minimax-tts, image optimization)
   - **Type B: Documentation** - Guidance only (seo-content-writer, automation-workflowsv)
   - **Type C: Plugin Required** - Needs external setup (task)

2. **Task Skill Value (If Set Up):**
   - Task management for One4Health project
   - Deadline tracking
   - Todo lists via Telegram
   - Week planning view

3. **Setup Required for Task Skill:**
   - Download/install tasker CLI binary
   - Configure OpenClaw plugin: `tasker_cmd`
   - Set `tasker` binary config
   - Test integration

### Recommendation:

**For Now:** Document the discovery and defer task skill setup. More value in:
- Testing skills that work out-of-the-box
- Using simple task lists in MD files
- Building integrations for immediate needs

**Setup Task Skill When:**
- Need complex task management with Telegram
- Have time to configure plugins
- tasker CLI is easily accessible

### Other Skill Testing Completed Today:

✅ **minimax-tts** (09:30 AM) - Working perfectly
✅ **web_fetch** (01:30 PM) - Fetching Netlify page successfully
- Status: web_fetch working for summarize capability

### 🧠 Key Lessons Learned

#### Lesson 1: Skills Have Three Types
**Discovery:** Not all skills are the same
- **Type A: Complete Integration** (minimax-tts, image) - Ready to use, no setup
- **Type B: Documentation Only** (seo-content-writer, automation-workflowsv) - Guidance, templates
- **Type C: External Dependencies** (task) - Requires CLI binary + plugin configuration

**Takeaway:** Verify skill type before installing. Prioritize Type A for immediate value.

#### Lesson 2: Capabilities Vary by Dependencies
**Discovery:** Some capabilities require external resources
- **Minimax-TTS:** Works out-of-box (no API key needed for skill itself)
- **Canvas Tool:** Requires paired node (physical hardware)
- **Web Search:** Requires BRAVE_API_KEY
- **Browser Tool:** Requires Chrome extension attached

**Takeaway:** Check dependencies before testing. Focus on what works now vs. what needs setup.

#### Lesson 3: Quality > Quantity in Documentation
**Discovery:** Detailed logs preserve knowledge and prevent re-learning
- 313 lines in memory/2026-02-10.md
- Every skill discovery documented
- Every capability test logged
- 8 git commits preserve progress

**Takeaway:** Document everything. Future-you will thank present-you.

#### Lesson 4: Git Auto-Commit is Reliable
**Discovery:** The git-auto-commit.ps1 script works perfectly
- Runs hourly (every 40 minutes of the hour)
- Checks one4health-website only (configured)
- No false positives, clean commits
- No issues with submodule (openclaw-skills-repo)

**Takeaway:** Trust the automation. Focus on creating content, not managing git.

#### Lesson 5: API Keys are Blockers
**Discovery:** Multiple capabilities require API access
- Web search (BRAVE_API_KEY) - needed for supplier research
- Browser (Chrome extension) - needed for competitor analysis
- Minimax (platform API key) - needed for TTS extension

**Takeaway:** Document what's working vs. what's blocked by API keys. User to provide when ready.

#### Lesson 6: Prompt Enhancer is Built but Disconnected
**Discovery:** The prompt-enhancer.ps1 system exists but isn't integrated
- Built and documented (Feb 3)
- Has config (enabled: true)
- Has log file (only 1 entry)
- NOT connected to OpenClaw message pipeline

**Takeaway:** Building ≠ Integrating. Verify integration, not just code existence.
**Decision:** Keep using conversational enhancement (working) vs. wrapper script (complexity).

### 🎯 Improvements Identified

#### Improvement 1: Focus on Skills That Work Out-of-Box
**Current:** 6 new skills installed, 1 tested (minimax-tts working)
**Next:** Test more Type A skills (image, email) that don't require external setup

#### Improvement 2: Defer Plugin-Dependent Skills
**Current:** Task skill documented but not tested (requires external binary)
**Next:** Wait for clear business need before external binary installation

#### Improvement 3: Document Skills by Type
**Current:** All 15 skills listed together
**Next:** Categorize by type (Complete, Doc, External) for easier reference

#### Improvement 4: Build What Works Now
**Current:** Research on suppliers/competitors blocked by API keys
**Next:** Focus on tasks that don't require API access (website rebuild, image optimization)

#### Improvement 5: Create Skills Testing Queue
**Current:** Testing ad-hoc as skills discovered
**Next:** Systematic testing plan:
  1. Test all Type A skills (Complete Integration)
  2. Document Type B skills (Read and apply guidance)
  3. Queue Type C skills (External) for business needs

---

### ✅ What Went Well Today

1. **Autonomous Workflow:** Self-improvement tasks completed every 2 hours without manual intervention
2. **Reliable Systems:** Gateway, cron jobs, git commits all working 100%
3. **Good Documentation:** Every task logged, 8 commits preserve progress
4. **Capability Discovery:** Learned which tools work and which need setup

2. **Research Blockers:** Supplier and competitor research blocked by API access
   - Next: Focus on available resources (existing documentation, manual research)
   - Next: Prepare query list for when API keys available

3. **Prompt Enhancer:** Built but never integrated
   - Decision: Keep conversational enhancement (working, low complexity)
   - Note: Document why wrapper script wasn't built (not worth the complexity)

4. One4Health homepage rebuild (awaiting user decision)
5. Minimax $10 subscription setup (if user purchases)

**When API Keys Available:**
6. Web search for new gummy suppliers
7. Browser automation for competitor website analysis

**Ongoing:**
7. Continue self-improvement checks (every 2 hours)
8. Skills discovery toward 25-skill target (15/25 = 60%)

### 🔮 Strategic Insights

**Insight 1: The "What Works Now" Principle**
> Focus on capabilities that work without external setup. Defer API-dependent tasks until user provides keys. Autonomous work shouldn't block on missing resources.

**Insight 2: Skill Type Categorization is Critical**
> Understanding if a skill is "ready to use" vs "documentation only" vs "requires setup" saves time and frustration. Test before documenting as "installed."

**Insight 3: Documentation Velocity > Code Velocity**
> 313 lines of detailed logs in one day creates cumulative knowledge. Each log entry compounds value over time. Future sessions can pick up today's work instantly.

**Insight 4: User Conversations Reveal Priorities**
> Website status inquiry, Minimax questions, task reminders → User wants focus on One4Health website + business automation. Align autonomous work accordingly.
