## Lessons Learned

1. **Anti-Gravity Model Issues:**
   - Claude Opus 4.5 no longer available
   - Claude Opus 4.6 not allowed
   - Had to use GLM-4.7:cloud for coding

2. **Netlify Static Site Deployment:**
   - Cannot use build.command for pure static sites
   - Publish directory should be "." not "index.html"
   - Use `netlify deploy --create-site <name>` for new sites

3. **Sub-Agent Reliability:**
   - Sub-agents accepted tasks but didn't execute properly
   - Better to build directly using coder model
   - Sessions_spawn works but quality varies

4. **User Preferences:**
   - NO gradients - solid colors only
   - Rounded buttons (border-radius: 50px)
   - Logo should be modest size (28px not 40px)
   - Real product images needed (currently placeholders)

1. **One4Health Website:**
   - Replace placeholder images with real product photos
   - Add gummy pack shot images
   - Add lifestyle/wellness images
   - Connect e-commerce/Cart functionality

2. **Supplier Decision:**
