## 📝 KEY LEARNINGS TODAY

### Formulation Science:
- KSM-66 is the gold standard for ashwagandha extracts
- Vitamin D3 (vegan) is 3-5x more effective than D2

- Social proof (followers, celebrity partnerships) matters

### Research Method:
- Using deepseek-r1 for complex research and analysis
- Web_fetch for primary data collection
- Comparative frameworks for decision-making

## 💡 TODAY'S INSIGHT
