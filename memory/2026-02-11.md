## 05:45 AM IST - Agent Capability Testing - Prompt Enhancer ✅

**Task:** Test prompt-enhancer patterns and document integration strategy
**Duration:** ~10 minutes
**Status:** COMPLETED

### Test Cases Executed:

1. **Business Prompt (One4Health Suppliers)**
   - Original: "Find Ashwagandha suppliers"
   - Enhanced: Added location, quality specs, capacity, contact requirements
   - Result: Much more specific and actionable

2. **Research Prompt (Market Trends)**
   - Original: "Research gummy market trends"
   - Enhanced: Added India focus, timeframe, search terms, output format
   - Result: Clear search strategy

3. **Design Prompt (Hero Section)**
   - Original: "Create a hero section for One4Health"
   - Enhanced: Added full design spec (colors, fonts, sizes, accessibility)
   - Result: Production-ready design brief

### Key Findings:

✅ **Prompt enhancement patterns are excellent**
- Business prompts benefit most (critical for One4Health)
- Design prompts become full specs
- Research prompts get structured approach

✅ **Integration Strategy Identified**
- Skill is built but doesn't auto-trigger in OpenClaw
- Recommendation: Train autonomous self-enhancement
- Apply pattern before executing complex business tasks

### Files Created/Updated:
- `prompt-enhancer-test.md` - Full test results and documentation
- `memory/2026-02-11.md` - Today's log
- `self-improvement.md` - Progress updated

### Next Task Suggestion:
**Autonomous Prompt Enhancement** - Apply prompt-enhancer patterns automatically when:
- User requests business-critical tasks (suppliers, partnerships)
- Vague requests need clarification
- Complex tasks with multiple requirements

### Impact:
**Better quality responses** - More specific, actionable, and thorough
**Reduced back-and-forth** - First response is more complete
**Business value** - Supplier queries, design specs, research all benefit
