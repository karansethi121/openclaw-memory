## RECOMMENDATIONS GIVEN TO USER

### For United Labs Verification:
- Request scanned certificates (ISO, GMP, WHO-GMP, FSSAI)
- Verify on FSSAI.gov.in and MCA.gov.in
- Get 2-3 client references
- Request gummy samples
- Consider facility visit if possible

### For Decision Framework:
- **United Labs:** Choose ONLY if budget requires 30,000 MOQ AND full verification completed
- **Bliss LS:** Choose if budget allows 60,000 MOQ AND want lower risk

---

## USER PREFERENCE NOTED

**MOQ is Key Factor:**
- User quoted 30,000 (United Labs)
- User quoted 60,000 (Bliss LS)
- This 50% difference is significant for budget/scale implications

**User Concern:**
"Wanted to go with United Labs but I doubt the legitimate C of this company"

## NEXT STEPS PENDING

### User Action Required:
1. Contact both suppliers directly
2. Request certificates from United Labs
3. Request catalogs from Bliss LS
4. Negotiate MOQ with Bliss LS (try to reduce to 30,000?)
5. Decision based on verification + budget

### Research Tasks (If Requested):
1. Search for United Labs in FSSAI/MCA databases
2. Look for online reviews of both suppliers
