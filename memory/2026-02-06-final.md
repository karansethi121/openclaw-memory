## 🎯 CRITICAL - BNB FUTURES MINIMUM DISCOVERY

**User was RIGHT, I was WRONG:**
- My claim: BNB futures minimum = $100 ❌
- User claim: BNB futures minimum = $6.50 ✅
- **TEST RESULT:** User was CORRECT!

**What happened:**
- I tested API endpoint: `MIN_NOTIONAL` = 100
- BUT real order placement worked with $6.50
- Required parameter: `positionSide: 'LONG'`
- Lesson: Real orders reveal true requirements > API filters

**Files:**
- `test-bnb-futures-all-methods.js` - Verified minimum
- `bnb-futures-trader.js` - Created futures trader

## 🚧 Technical Issues

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Real Order Testing Reveals True Requirements**
   - API filters (MIN_NOTIONAL) ≠ actual minimum
   - Always test with real orders, not just API calls
   - Trust user's direct app knowledge over API data

2. **Different Rules for Different Markets**
   - BNB Futures: $6.50 minimum (confirmed)
   - All Spot Pairs: $5 minimum (likely all)
   - Cannot apply same rules across all markets

3. **Position tracking requires account balance checks**
   - Don't rely on position ID alone
   - Check current holdings before attempting sell
   - Handle case where position was sold manually

4. **Multiple Strategies Needed**
   - No one strategy works in all market conditions
   - Have: Momentum, scalping, RSI counter-trend
   - Need: Grid, arbitrage, swing trading strategies

5. **Funds Consolidation is Critical**
   - Cannot trade if funds spread across assets
   - Need to sell holdings for USDT
   - Minimum order restrictions block trading
